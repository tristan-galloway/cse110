Write a program that asks the user for their favorite letter. Then, loop through a programmed word one letter at a time. If the letter in the programmed word is the user's favorite, print it out as a capital letter (or "hide" it), if not, print it out as a lower case letter.

# Add an additional feature to your program so that the user can enter another number and see it's result. To do this, you should ask the user if they would like to enter another number, and continue looping as long as they type yes.
